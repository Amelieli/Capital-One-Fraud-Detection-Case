#Fraud Detection Case
This is a case to play around with categorical data and detect fraudulent credit card transactions.\
In Session 1, EDA will be performed to learn about the meanings of columns and data. Then I'll do some imputations.\
In Session 2, in order to prepare for modeling, categorial data and numeric data will be identified and account level aggregation will be atempted.\
In Session 3, I'll build a CatBoost model to train the data and predict the probability of a fraudulent transaction. Confusion matrix will be used to evaluate the model performance. 
In Session 4, AutoGluon will be attempted to find the optimal model for this problem. Due to insufficient memory of my laptop, this step has to be done in Google Cloud Platform. 
In summary, this case is very challenging but it has a lot of practical uses.
